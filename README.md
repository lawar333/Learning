 <h1>12 Daily Habits to Better Your Life</h1>
          <h2>That You Might Not Know!</h2>
        <p>I'm considered an Xennial...slapped right between the Gen X'ers and the Millenials. My childhood didn't really involve technology, but my early 20's did. I was the child who was typing my sister's book reports because I could type so fast. I was the student who did all of my classmates assignments in CS class because we couldn't talk until they were done, and they were slow as molassas.</p>
        <p>Going from a non-tech world to a tech world gave me a world of advantages. I can related to those that struggle with technology, becuase I grew up hearing how computers were just a fad and would never last. I can relate to those that can never unplug from their phone, because well, it's just plain addictive. I'd rather read a book or play outside than watch tv.</p>
        <p>Here, I list ways where we can call upon old and mix with the new.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Turn off your shower water while you're soaping up and scrubbing. This conserves a non-renewable resource and really isn't that inconvenient. It will also give you a moment each day to reflect on what we really need and what we really use.</li>
            <li>Wear your clothes more than once before throwing them in the dirty clothes. I'm in the habit of hanging up everything after I wear, as long as it pasts the smell test. </li>
            <li>Run water in your sink to soak dishes after using them. This will allow stubborn food to easily come off without much elbow grease or time spent on your part.</li>
            <li>Read. Every day. And not just your cell phone. Reading is proven to affect our brains and can actually rewire the way we think for a few days after reading a book. Reading also affords you the opportunity to "walk in anothers' shoes." It enhances empathy and compassion. Something this world could use more of.</li>
            <li>Go outside. Going outside decreases feelings of depression and anxiety. Trees are even better if you live in an area where you have access to trees. If the weather allows, take your shoes off and "ground" yourself. You'll feel better and think better. And there's no price tag.</li>
            <li>Laugh. Laughter is medicine. Yes, it's old. And we can always use more of it. If you can't find anything to laugh at, laugh at yourself. It's actually good for you and helps you to not take yourself so seriously.</li>
            <li>Food. You are what you eat so only eat ambitious! Ok, in all seriousness, you are what you eat does take effect the older you get. Crap in, crap out. You'll feel better if you eat healthy. So just do it.</li>
            <li>Exercise. Activity breeds activity. Inactivity breeds inactivity. Meaning, if you just sit around all day, you wont feel good. Get up and move. However you can. Even if you just squeeze your glutes while sitting down. I used to shake my foot to help me keep going even while sitting. Find what works for you and do it.</li>
            <li>Hug. Hugs make everyone feel better and is proven to help fight off disease. If you don't have someone you can hug, get a dog or a cat and hug them. Just the feeling of a warm body next to yours can do wonders to help your mental health.</li>
            <li>Music. Upbeat music can help improve your mood and fight off depression and anxiety. Singing and dancing are two other things you can add to music to make your spirits lift through the roof. If you can't do all three, just start with one. You'll find soon you'll be wanting to sing and dance along with your favorite song.</li>
            <li>Start reading labels. Wether it's your food, your shampoo, your body lotion or even your chapstick, start knowing what you're putting into your body. Chemicals affect us. They can cause depression, disease and other ailments. Don't trust a multi-billion dollar corporation to protect you or have your best interests in mind. You need to have your OWN best interests in mind.</li>
            <li>Meditation/Yoga. You need that time to clear your mind and just BE. In a world we're constantly bombarded with sensory information, our minds can become overwhelmed and exhausted. Take this time to quiet your mind, relax, and focus on the things that matter...your breath, your health, your life.</li>
            
            <p>These are simple, easy things that we can do daily to help us become more intune with ourselves and our world. What do you do when you start feeling overwhelmed or out of tune?
